# Codewars Challenges
Codewars is a platform where developers can deepen their understanding of a given language through programming challenges (called kata). These start out at level 8 (beginner) and progress downward toward level 1 (proficiency). As part of my coding journey, I have ventured to complete at least one kata each day to gain experience problem-solving and utilizing Javascript's many features.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

After completing challenges, I save my solutions in this repository so I can refer back to them in the future to account for any missed edge cases and perform optimization.

## Lessons Learned:

The challenges on Codewars (and others on similar platforms) have taught me the importance of having a system for problem-solving. Where my instinct may to immediately start coding, I have seen the most progress come when I step back, plan out my solution in pseudocode, build out test cases and run through each line of code in my mind before ever clicking 'run.'
